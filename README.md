# waypoint-based-destructible-terrain

## Idea

For destructible 2D landscapes, you would normally use a approach with a huge grid of single pixels or a polygon-based approach. This techdemo here experiments with a new(?) technique called "waypoint based destructible terrain" using a net of waypoints as "tunnels" in solid material. This should have its advantages and its disadvantages.
