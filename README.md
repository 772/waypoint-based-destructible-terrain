# octagon-destructible-landscape-techdemo

Idea: For destructible 2D landscapes, you would normally use a approach with a huge grid of single pixels or a polygon-based approach. This techdemo here experiments with a new(?) technique called ```octagon-destructible-landscape``` using simple octagons as "tunnels" in solid material. This should have its advantages and its disadvantages.
