# waypoint_based_destructible_terrain

A techdemo showing an AI friendly destructible terrain for side-scrolling games. It works by using a waypoint net that is both used for AI players and rendering the landscape.

For destructible 2D landscapes, you would normally use a approach with a huge grid of single pixels (bitmap) or a polygon-based approach. Both approaches can be advanced using techniques like marching squares or quadtrees. However, both approaches have their difficulties with AI players.
